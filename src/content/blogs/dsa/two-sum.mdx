## Question
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
<br/>
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
<br/>
You can return the answer in any order.

#### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`<br/>
Output: `[0,1]`<br/>
Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

#### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [3,2,4]`, `target = 6`<br/>
Output: `[1,2]`

#### Example 3:
Input: `nums = [3,3]`, `target = 6`<br/>
Output: `[0,1]`


#### Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- Only one valid answer exists.
